        "Conditions are things that need to be met before we change tasks. We can find out if a condition is met by comparing two values. To do this, we use something called logical operators. Logical operators return either `True`, if the statement is true, or `False`, if the statement is false. Remember: `True` and `False` values are called booleans.\n",

This would give us `True` if the temperature is above freezing and `False` if the temperature is at or below freezing.\n",

        "\n",
        "Try to play around with some logical operators in Jupyter Notebooks. Notice how the single equal sign and double equal signs have different meanings. The single equal sign assigns a value to a variable, while the double equal sign compares values. This difference is a common gotcha that a beginner programmer can face. \n",
