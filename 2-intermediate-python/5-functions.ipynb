For example, if you wrote code to count the number of basalt rocks, it would probably be almost identical to the code needed to count highland rocks. Instead of making an `if` statement to check the type of every single space rock, we can write a function for the space rocks and it can run the same code to check which type of rock it is each time.\n",
